# FAQ

## What is common.ink?
common.ink gives your AI tools persistent memory and a live server. Your assistants can store notes and deploy apps through one account across ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, and other MCP or HTTP clients.

## What is MCP?
MCP stands for Model Context Protocol, an open standard for connecting AI tools to external services. common.ink is an MCP server, so compatible clients can connect through OAuth.

## Do I need to be a developer?
No. If you can use ChatGPT or Claude, you can use common.ink. You can ask your AI to save notes, retrieve context, and ship simple apps without learning CLI-heavy workflows.

## What can I deploy?
Single-file web apps written by your AI in common stacks like Python, Node.js, or Go. Apps get an isolated runtime and a public URL.

## Is my data private?
Each account uses isolated, encrypted storage. Notes and app code are scoped to your account and are never shared across users.

## How is this different from Replit, Lovable, or Bolt?
Those products center on their own chat/editor surface. common.ink works inside the AI tools you already use, adding memory and deployment without forcing a new interface.

## How is this different from Vercel or Railway?
Those are deployment platforms built for direct developer workflows. common.ink focuses on AI-first workflows where your assistant can create and deploy on your behalf.

## What does pricing include?
- Free: 100 MB note storage, 1 live app, 10 requests/second, web + MCP access
- Pro: unlimited note storage, 5 live apps, 1,000 requests/second, priority support
