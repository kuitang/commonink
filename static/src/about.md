# About common.ink

**Ink makes your AI real.**

## What is common.ink?
common.ink is the persistent layer for AI tools. It gives assistants memory that lasts and infrastructure that runs, while keeping user data isolated and encrypted.

## Key Features

### Persistent Memory
Store notes once and retrieve them from any connected client. Save meeting summaries, research, specs, and checklists so your assistants can reuse context instead of starting over.

### Live App Deployment
Move from prompt to running URL. common.ink provides managed runtime infrastructure so AI-generated apps can be deployed and served.

### MCP + HTTP Connectivity
Works with ChatGPT, Claude, Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, and custom clients through MCP and HTTP interfaces.

### Security by Default
Each user gets isolated encrypted storage with strict account boundaries.

## For Developers

common.ink provides:
- REST API for note and account operations
- MCP endpoint for agent integrations
- API keys and OAuth 2.1 for authenticated access

See [API Documentation](/docs/api) for details.

## Positioning

common.ink is not a replacement chat app or code host UI. It is the durability and execution layer behind the tools you already use.
